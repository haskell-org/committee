# Write access to haskell.org website repo

The Haskell.org committee welcomes PRs from community contributors to
the haskell.org website.  However, for security purposes it is
important to restrict direct write access to the repository which the
website is built from.

This policy determines who should have write access to any settings
and source repositories associated with the www.haskell.org website.
The settings and source repositories are currently hosted on the
GitHub platform, at
<https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/>.

* All members of the Haskell.org committee should have write access,
  to be used for carrying out their normal duties around the website.

* All members of the Haskell.org committee will, on request, be
  granted the highest level of admin access.  For redundancy purposes,
  at all times there should be at least three committee members with
  the highest level of admin access.

* All members of the Haskell.org infrastructure admins team will, on
  request, be granted write access, for carrying out their normal
  duties around maintenance of Haskell.org infrastructure.

* By vote of the Haskell.org committee others may be granted write
  access to the settings and source repositories, for a limited time
  and for a limited purpose, if the Haskell.org committee deems such
  access necessary.

* No one else may have write access to the settings and source
  repositories under any other circumstances.
