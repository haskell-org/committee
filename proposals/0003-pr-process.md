# Accepting Website PRs

To quickly triage and accept PRs to the website, we need a process for reviewing, merging and deploying changes. Our goal is to streamline uncontroversial site changes while ensuring that potentially controversial decisions are made transparently and with community input.

PRs fall into two categories:

  1. Potentially controversial: changes to website content that people in the community feel strongly about. This includes changes that endorse or highlight specific projects, tools or organizations as well as anything else that might spark or require community discussion.

    Potentially controversial changes should be brought to the full committee for a vote, potentially with other steps (like a community-wide request for comments).

  2. Uncontroversial: everything else like technical tweaks, adding new links/resources and bringing website content up to date.

    Uncontroversial changes can be approved by either one committee member who did not work on the PR or two members who worked on a PR together.

Ultimately, whether or not a change is potentially controversial is a judgement call. Committee members should feel free to hold off on approving and merging PRs if they are unsure or want more input and discussion, and PRs should not be merged if any committee member actively disagrees with the change. If two or more committee members can't agree on a PR, the issue should be brought up to the whole committee.

Once a PR is merged, it can be deployed at any time. (Ideally, deploying will be fully automated in the near future.)
