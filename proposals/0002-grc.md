# Guidelines for Respectful Communication

The Haskell.org committee adopts the
[Guidelines for Respectful Communication](grc).

This applies only to members of the board, in in all our public interactions in
the Haskell sphere, including email, social media, discussion forums, and so on.

We may later adopt a stricter Code of Conduct, or set a Code of Conduct for
platforms we manage (e.g. Discourse, mailing lists), but that is out of scope
for this proposal.
