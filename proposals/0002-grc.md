# Guidelines for Respectful Communication

The Haskell.org committee adopts the
[Guidelines for Respectful Communication][grc].

This applies only to members of the board, in all our public interactions in
the Haskell sphere, including email, social media, discussion forums, and so on, as they pertain to our status as representatives of Haskell.org.

We may later adopt a stricter Code of Conduct, or set a Code of Conduct for
platforms we manage (e.g. Discourse, mailing lists), but that is out of scope
for this proposal.

## Resolution

This proposal was accepted by a 5/7 majority on 15 November 2020:

 -  Alexandre Garcia de Oliveira
 -  George Wilson
 -  Jasper Van der Jeugt
 -  Rebecca Skinner
 -  Tikhon Jelvis

Emily Pillmore voted against the proposal, noting that this CoC does not have
any punitive effects and is thus somewhat useless in that area.

It was discussed on the `community@haskell.org` mailing list here:
