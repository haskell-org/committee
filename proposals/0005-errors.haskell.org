# Delegate authority over the `errors.haskell.org` domain name records to the Haskell Foundation

## Background

The Haskell Foundation is working on adding uniform error codes to all the errors and warnings produced by GHC, and creating a web site for documenting errors based on their codes. This is inspired by the Rust error index site at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html>. Eventually, the hope is that similar error codes will be produced by other Haskell tools, allowing this site to be useful for more than just GHC someday.

The Haskell Foundation would like to host this site at `errors.haskell.org`. The Haskell Foundation will be responsible for ensuring that the site stays up to date and for soliciting contributions.

## Policy

The Haskell.org committee delegates authority over the `errors.haskell.org` domain name records to the Haskell Foundation for the purpose of hosting a public website related to error messages from Haskell tooling.
